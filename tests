< in1 < in2 cat > out1 > out2 | ls <-- ls doesn't work if first pipe command doesn't work
< in1 < in7 cat > out1 > out2 | something (IF SOMETHING PATH COMMAND, DOESN'T WORK)
    FIXED


< eof1 << eof cat > out1 > out2 <--- Heredoc should be executed before permission denied shows up
    FIXED
< eof1 << eof cat > out1 > out2 <--- EXECUTING HEREDOC TWICE
    FIXED

< eof1 << here AND cat < eof1 << here <--- Have different behaviour, study it
    FIXED


<< eof << eof cat > out1 > out2 <-- CONTROL C IS LAKCING because of cat. control c is skipping but executing the stuff. COntrol c should stop everything
<< eof << eof cat > out1 > out2 | echo salve <--- CONTROL C STOPS EVERYTHING IN THIS CASE, WHY?
    FIXED



<< eof << eof cat > out1 > out2 <--- PRINTING BOTH EOF ON OUT2 INSTEAD OF JUST THE LAST
