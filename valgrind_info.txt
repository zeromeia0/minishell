AND AND OR OPERATIONS ARE BEING FUCKED UP WHEN COMBINIS WITH PIPES

ls -l | grep a | echo oi && cat << a


echo salve && cat << salve | cat | cat | ls -l && echo DIVISOR | << eof cat > out69



VALGRIND ISSUE
    pwd && ls -l | grep b
    exit | exit
    echo a | ls

    << a
    cat << a
    << eof cat > out11

ls | echo a | << a

<< a << b | << c && cat << d
